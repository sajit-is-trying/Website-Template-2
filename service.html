            <p>
              I am Ben Carling, the owner and head coach at Sports Performance
              Services Ltd, based in Douglas, Isle of Man. After studying
              business management, I decided embark in a career that was also a
              passion of mine; health and fitness. I had played sports from an
              early age so it seemed a natural thing to do. I became a qualified
              Personal Trainer, and latterly an accredited Strength and
              Conditioning coach with the UKSCA. Currently there are only 4
              accredited coaches in the Isle of Man, and circa 600 in the UK
            </p>
            .
            <p class="pop">
              As well as private work, I work at the Isle of Man Sport
              Institute. I work with a wide cross section of athletes from
              different sports, from field based sports such as football, rugby
              and hockey to individual sports such as archery, sailing, tennis,
              motorsport and swimming. I am proud to have played my part in
              helping these athletes set personal bests, Island records and some
              that have gone on to achieve scholarships or youth contracts at
              professional level.
